      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Sunlight Enters the Atmosphere:**\n",
      "   Sunlight, appearing white to us, is actually a mixture of all colors of the rainbow. When this light enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters various particles and gases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Scattering of Light:**\n",
      "   The molecules of nitrogen and oxygen, which make up most of the atmosphere, are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. This size difference causes the sunlight to scatter in all directions. This scattering is more effective for shorter wavelengths, like blue and violet.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Rayleigh Scattering:**\n",
      "   This type of scattering, named after Lord Rayleigh, is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This means blue light (with a shorter wavelength) is scattered about 10 times more effectively than red light (with a longer wavelength).\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Our Perception:**\n",
      "   As we look up at the sky, we see the scattered blue light coming from all directions. This scattered light reaches our eyes, making the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Not Violet?**\n",
      "You might wonder, if violet light scatters even more strongly than blue, why isn't the sky violet? There are two main reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sunlight Intensity:** The sun emits less violet light compared to blue.\n",
      "* **Eye Sensitivity:** Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therefore, the combination of Rayleigh scattering, the sun's spectral output, and our eye's sensitivity results in our perception of a blue sky.** \n",
