Attend free or discounted events, such as student concerts or cultural shows, and take advantage of student discounts at movie theaters.\n\n2. **Food and Basic Needs**: Be a discerning shopper by researching product quality and considering generic options. Purchase items in bulk when cost-effective, and utilize coupons and rebates. Prepare home-cooked meals and pack lunches to avoid the high costs of dining out.\n\n3. **Clothing**: Purchase clothing at the end of the season when prices are reduced. Sell or consign clothes you no longer wear, and consider sharing formal attire with friends.

Avoid using credit cards if they lead to unnecessary purchases, and set spending limits before shopping.\n\n5. **Transportation**: Adhere to traffic laws to avoid fines and increased insurance premiums.
