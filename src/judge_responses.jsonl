Smokers who quit can reduce their risk of developing dementia.\\n \\n diabetes \\n People with type 2 diabetes in mid-life (ages 45 to 65) are at an increased risk of developing dementia, particularly Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia.\\n \\n Obesity\\n Obesity in mid-life (ages 45 to 65) increases the risk of developing dementia. Obesity also increases the risk of developing other risk factors such as type 2 diabetes.\\n \\n lack of physical activity \\n Physical inactivity in later life (ages 65 and up) increases the risk of developing dementia.\\n \\n poor diet\\n An unhealthy diet, high in saturated fat, sugar, and salt, can increase the risk of developing many illnesses, including dementia and cardiovascular disease.\\n \\n high alcohol consumption \\n Drinking excessively (more than 12 drinks per week), can increase your risk of developing dementia\\n \\n low cognitive engagement \\n Cognitive engagement is thought to support the development of a\\n \u201ccognitive reserve\u201d.

However, the relationship between depression and dementia is still unclear.\\n \\n Many researchers believe that depression is a risk factor for dementia, whereas others believe it may be an early symptom of the disease, or both.\\n \\n traumatic brain injury \\n People who experience severe or repeated head injuries are at increased risk of developing dementia. Brain injuries may trigger a process that might eventually lead to dementia.\\n \\n This particularly affects athletes in boxing, soccer, hockey, and football, which often have repeated head injuries.\\n \\n Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury. Falling is especially dangerous for older adults.\\n \\n hearing loss\\n Mild levels of hearing loss increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Though it is still unclear how exactly it affects cognitive decline, hearing loss can lead to social isolation, loss of independence, and problems with everyday activities.\\n \\n social isolation\\n Social isolation can increase the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, depression, and dementia.\\n \\n Staying socially active may reduce the risk of dementia.
